It is recommended to put the JavaScript at the end, as the web pages are loaded from head to bottom.
However, it some cases, you can have asynchronous JavaScript, meaning it could be put anywhere as it will load side by side with the page.
If you have a really long script, you should put it on an external file, so it doesn't mess up the content of your page.
If your javascript code is really short, then it is ok to have within the same page.
