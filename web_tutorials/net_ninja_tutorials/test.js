/**
Little rules for JavaScript
1) JavaScript is case sensitive
2) every statement ends with a semicolon, and a statement is basically an action you want JavaScript to do (ie alert message, change background, etc. )
3) White space doesn't matter
4) Comments are done in the same way as in Java
5) JavaScript runs from top to bottom

var myVariableCarlos;
myVariableCarlos=10;
console.log("myVariableCarlos is equal to: "+myVariableCarlos+". \nJavaScript treats variables similar to python. In other words, you don't have to declare the type of variable. Everything is expressed with just the keyword 'var'");
